# Changelog repair, run by git-cliff as a commit_preprocessor (see
# .github/cliff.toml). Reads a commit message on stdin, writes it back on
# stdout - unchanged, except for one case.
#
# The changelog prose lives in the squash-commit body, which is the PR
# description (repo squash defaults PR_TITLE/PR_BODY). A merge that submits an
# empty description field overrides that default, and the note is gone from
# history for good - commit messages are immutable, and git-cliff's GitHub
# integration exposes pr_title/pr_number/pr_labels but no pr_body to fall back
# on.
#
# So when a squashed-PR commit carries no `## Release notes` section, fetch it
# from the PR that produced it and append it to the message before git-cliff
# parses. The changelog and the GitHub release body both render from this, so
# both are correct regardless of how the merge was performed. Side benefit: a
# note can be corrected after merge by editing the PR description.
#
# Every failure path prints the message unchanged - a missing `gh`, no auth, no
# network, or an unparseable subject must never break changelog generation,
# which also runs locally (`git-cliff --unreleased`).
